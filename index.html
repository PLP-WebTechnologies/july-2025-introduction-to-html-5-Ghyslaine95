        <h3>HTML5 Definition</h3>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language): It first appeared in 1991 with the launch of the Web. <br> Its role is to manage
and organize content. Therefore, it's in HTML that you write what should be displayed on the page: text, links,
images, etc. <br> For example, you could say: "This is my title, this is my menu, here is the main text of the page, here is an
image to display, etc."</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>HTML5 tags</h3>
        <p>HTML pages are filled with what are called tags. These are invisible onscreen to your visitors, but they
allow the computer to understand what to display. <br>
Tags are easy to spot. They are surrounded by "angle brackets," that is, the < and > symbols, like this:
<tag> <br>
 What are they for? They indicate the nature of the text they surround. For example, they mean: <br> "This is the
title of the page," "This is an image," "This is a paragraph of text," etc.

        <h3>SEO Optimization</h3>
        <p>SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of improving a website's visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs) to attract more organic (unpaid) traffic. <br>
          It involves optimizing various aspects of a website, including its content, structure, and technical elements, to make it more appealing to both users and search engines.</p>
